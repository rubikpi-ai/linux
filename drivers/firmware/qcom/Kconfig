	  Selects the mode of the memory allocator providing memory buffers of
	  suitable format for sharing with the TrustZone. If in doubt, select
	  'Generic'.

config QCOM_TZMEM_MODE_GENERIC

	help
	  Use the generic allocator mode. The memory is page-aligned, non-cachable
	  and physically contiguous.

config QCOM_TZMEM_MODE_SHMBRIDGE
	bool "SHM Bridge"
	help
	  Use Qualcomm Shared Memory Bridge. The memory has the same alignment as
	  in the 'Generic' allocator but is also explicitly marked as an SHM Bridge
	  buffer.

	  With this selected, all buffers passed to the TrustZone must be allocated
	  using the TZMem allocator or else the TrustZone will refuse to use them.

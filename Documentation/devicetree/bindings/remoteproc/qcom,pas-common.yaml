    description:
      Qualcommâ€™s PAS implementation for remote processors only supports a
      single stage of IOMMU translation and is presently managed by the
      Qualcomm EL2 hypervisor (QHEE) if it is present. In the absence of QHEE,
      such as with a KVM hypervisor, IOMMU translations need to be set up by
      the KVM host. Remoteproc might need some device resources and related
      access permissions to be set before it comes up, and this information is
      presently available statically with QHEE.

      In the absence of QHEE, the boot firmware needs to overlay this
      information based on SoCs running with either QHEE or a KVM hypervisor
      (CPUs booted in EL2).

      The qcom,devmem property provides IOMMU devmem translation information
      intended for non-QHEE based systems. It is an array of u32 values
      describing the device memory regions for which IOMMU translations need to
      be set up before bringing up Remoteproc. This array consists of 4-tuples
      defining the device address, physical address, size, and attribute flags
      with which it has to be mapped.

          ...

                        <0x92000 0x92000 0x1000 0x1>;
